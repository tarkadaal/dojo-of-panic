# dojo-of-panic
Hello Trainees! Welcome to Dan's Dojo of Python Programming Panic!

Any code I write for these sessions will be in this repository, so that:
* I won't need to share each file in the chat
* You won't need to search through the chat to find what you want
* You can access it on your personal computers, not just official company computers.

## How to start

1. Get thee to thy terminal! 
2. `cd` to a nice directory, "documents", "projects", something like that.
3. Type the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-riviera-kid/dojo-of-panic.git
```
  * This will create a new folder, containing everything in this repository.
